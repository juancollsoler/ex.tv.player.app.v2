NOTE

  Please refer to the main README for general information on Gentle.NET.


BUILDING

  Use NAnt and the included build file (Build/Gentle.build) to build under Mono.
  
  You will need a recent version of NAnt (0.85 or newer) to perform a successful 
  build.
    
  
ISSUES

  There are currently no known issues with Mono, provided that you use Mono 
  1.1.4 or later. Note that Mono 1.1.8 is broken and should not be used with
  Gentle. Mono 1.1.9 works as expected, and the general recommendation is to
  use the latest available release.

  However, because the release process does not involve formal testing under 
  Mono, it is possible that Mono-specific bugs will appear.
  
  Please submit Mono-related bug reports directly to morten@mertner.com.
