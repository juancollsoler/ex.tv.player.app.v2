	/// The <see cref="Gentle.Framework.Tests"/> namespace contains example business objects using
	/// the framework as well as NUnit test cases for exercising much of the functionality provided.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The most extensive and illustrative example of a business object using the framework is the 
	/// <see cref="MailingList"/> class. Usage of the <see cref="MailingList"/> class can be seen in 
	/// <see cref="TestList"/>, which contains methods to exercise the framework in a various ways. 
	/// Study of the two source files should be enough to show you how to use the framework in your 
	/// own projects.
