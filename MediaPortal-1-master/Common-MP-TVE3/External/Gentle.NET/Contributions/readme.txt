INTRODUCTION

  This file is intended to give a short explanation of what you can find in
  the Contributions folder. 


MYGENERATION TEMPLATES

  MyGeneration (www.mygenerationsoftware.com) comes bundled with a template 
  for autogenerating Gentle business objects. It is the recommended choice,
  unless you have a preference for using CodeSmith and SQL Server. Please
  download the latest edition from the MyGeneration home page.
  
  More information on the Gentle.NET template can be found here:

  Note that the version distributed in the Gentle.NET Contributions folder may be
  newer than what is published on the MyGeneration site, since it is a development
  copy.
  
CODESMITH TEMPLATES

  The .cst files are CodeSmith templates, which can be used to autogenerate a
  Gentle-compatible business object from an existing database schema.

  You will need to have CodeSmith installed and use SQL Server as your database
  backend to use them.

  They are currently not a supported part of the Gentle distribution and are
  provided here for your convenience only.

  Thanks goes out to Roger Hendriks and James Curran for these contributions.

  MERGE SUPPORT

  The GentleBusinessObjectWithMerge template supports region merging provided by
  the CodeSmith.RegionMergeStrategies.dll, which must be copied to the CodeSmith
  installation directory.
  
  Some autogenerated business objects needs to be modified after generation. When
  these modifications are placed in the "custom" regions of the 
  GentleBusinessObjectWithMerge-template, the contents are retained, even after
  rerunning the code generation.
