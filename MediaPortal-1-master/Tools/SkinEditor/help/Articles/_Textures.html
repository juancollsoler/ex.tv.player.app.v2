		<h1>Smart Textures - Improving Texture Rendering for MediaPortal</h1>
		<p>Most of the controls and screens that run inside the MediaPortal engine use 
			images to generate their look and feel.&nbsp; While this gives the designer a 
			lot of flexibility and ultimate control over the appearance of the screen or 
			control they are working on, it also presents some problems.&nbsp; Most of 
			these problems are due to the fact that when a control is resized, and its 
			appearance is reliant on images, then these images are also resized.&nbsp; 
			Resizing images tends to distort and pixelate the image, and thus the control 
			does not "look" right.&nbsp; This is demonstrated below.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" ID="Table1" class="Figure" width="351">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img border="0" src="_images/button01n.jpg" width="170" height="40"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 1 - A typical control rendered using a single image.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The above diagram shows what a button will look like when it is rendered using a 
			single image and sized to 170 pixels (width) by 38 pixels (height).&nbsp; If 
			the control maintains the same 170x38 dimensions, then the control will always 
			render correctly.&nbsp; However, this is not the case if the control is 
			resized.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" ID="table10" class="Figure" width="512">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img border="0" src="_images/button01s.jpg" width="494" height="38"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 2 - Another control rendered using the same image as the above example, 
						but with a size that is different then the image.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This diagram illustrates what happens when an image is used to render a button 
			that is not the same size as this image.&nbsp; To accommodate the size of the 
			control, the image needs to be stretched.&nbsp; This stretching causes the 
			rendering to become pixelated, especially in detailed areas and edges.&nbsp; 
			Therefore, if the skin designer wants to create a skin that does not suffer 
			from image stretching, a different image would have to be created for every 
			button that is going to be a different size.&nbsp; This is definitely not a 
			desirable solution as it would be almost impossible to determine ahead of time 
			the sizes of all possible buttons.</p>
		<p>In order to solve the problem, a common pattern can be applied that has been 
			used by web designers for quite some time now.&nbsp; Essentially what is done, 
			is the image is split into several regions.&nbsp; These regions can then be 
			combined together in an intelligent way to produce the final image.&nbsp; This 
			process will highly reduce and in some cases completely eliminate the 
			undesirable effects produced by stretching images.&nbsp; Using our example from 
			above, the image will be split into three regions.</p>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<table border="0" id="table26" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffff">
						<tr>
							<td><img border="0" src="_images/button01l.jpg" width="12" height="38"></td>

								<img border="0" src="_images/button01c.jpg" width="60" height="38"></td>

			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 3 - Splitting the image into three regions.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As illustrated in FIGURE 3, the original button image has been split into three 
			regions.&nbsp; The first region will be used to render the left side of the 
			button, the second, to render the middle or content area of the button, and the 
			third, to render the right side of the button.&nbsp; These regions will then be 
			combined as follows.&nbsp; The first region and third regions will never be 
			stretched.&nbsp; The second region will then be stretched to be the width of 
			the button minus the width of the first and third regions.&nbsp; For 
			example:&nbsp; If the first and third regions have a width of 10 pixels, and we 
			want a button to be 200 pixels wide, then middle image would be stretched to 
			200 - 10 - 10 = 180 pixels.&nbsp; Since the middle region does not contain any 
			fine details, stretching the middle region will actually not affect the final 
			rendered image.&nbsp;

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As illustrated in FIGURE 4, the process described above can be used quite 
			effectively to produce buttons of any width!&nbsp; When you compare FIGURE 2 
			with FIGURE 4, the differences are quite noticeable.&nbsp; Pay close attention 
			to the left and right side of the button, as the pixelated areas have been 
			eliminated.&nbsp; It should be kept in mind that this process will only allow 
			the button to be scaled horizontally, and requires the height of the button to 
			remain constant.&nbsp; This method of rendering images can therefore be used 
			for horizontal scrollbars, list items, progress bars, or essentially any 
			control that can be rendered effectively while maintaining a fixed 
			height.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A similar process can be applied to controls that maintain a fixed width 
			(vertical scrollbars).&nbsp; However instead of splitting the image into three 
			regions from left to right, the image will be split into three regions from top 
			to bottom.&nbsp; The top and bottom regions will remain fixed, while the middle 
			region will again be scaled to correctly render the control.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>A slightly more complex process can be used to render controls that need to 
			scaled both horizontally and vertically (dialogs and groups).&nbsp; To 
			illustrate this process, lets take the following image which can be used to 
			form a very nice background for a group control.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" ID="table20" class="Figure" width="332">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img border="0" src="_images/group01n.jpg" width="310" height="375"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 5 - A sample group background.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Now, here's an example of what the image will look like if it is scaled.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" ID="table21" class="Figure" width="332">
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img border="0" src="_images/group01s.jpg" width="512" height="128"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 6 - Stretching the group background.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The resulting image is not very appealing, as the nice round and smooth corners 
			from FIGURE 5 have been replaced with jagged, stretched corners and the 
			thickness of the vertical borders has increased while the thickness of the 
			horizontal borders has decreased.&nbsp; Currently, to prevent this from 
			happening, designers have been forced to supply a different image for each 
			group and dialog background that is a different size.&nbsp; However, as 
			mentioned above, this is not a very scalable or desirable solution.&nbsp; So, 
			like the solution posed above for FixedWidth and FixedHeight controls, the 
			image will be split into several regions.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<table border="0" width="294" id="table24" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" class="Figure">

					<table border="0" id="table25" cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#ffffff">

				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>FIGURE 6 - Splitting the image into 9 regions so that it can be scaled both 
						vertically and horizontally.</b></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As shown above, the image needs to be split into 9 different regions.&nbsp; The 
			4 corners will retain their size.&nbsp; The top and bottom images retain their 
			height, but can be scaled to any width.&nbsp; The left and right images will 
			retain their width, but can be scaled to any height.&nbsp; The center image 
			will be stretched both vertically and horizontally, so the designer does have 
			to pay some attention to this image.&nbsp; In most situations however, the 
			center image will be quite simple, providing a background for the content that 
			will be displayed in the group or dialog.</p>

			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The resulting image looks much better than FIGURE 5 as the borders as the same 
			size, and the corners are once again round and smooth.&nbsp; As mentioned 
			previously, this approach of splitting images into regions, and rendering the 
			final image from these regions is not a unique concept.&nbsp; Web designers use 
			this technique quite frequently when designing tables on their pages.&nbsp; At 
			the same time, many skinning engines such as Window Blinds also rely on this 
			technique so that a limited set of images can be used to render controls of 
			many different sizes.&nbsp; To implement this change in MediaPortal, both the 
			GUI Engine and the Screen XML structure would have to be slightly modified, but 
			the modifications are well worth it, in my opinion.&nbsp; This technique will 
			make skins look significantly better, will make it much easier on the person 
			designing the images for the skin, and will allow the skin to scale to 
			different resolutions more easily, especially the HDTV resolutions.&nbsp;
