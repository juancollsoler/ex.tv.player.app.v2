		<h1>Control Layout</h1>
		<p>This tutorial will describe several different techniques that can be used to 
			position the controls on your screens.&nbsp; Control layout is actually a key 
			component of the MediaPortalEditor and allows the designer to easily and 
			quickly position controls without having to manually type in X,Y coordinates 
			(however this option is available to the designer if required). A control is 
			positioned inside a container.&nbsp; How the control is positioned inside its 
			container is determined primarily by its containers layout style.&nbsp; There 
			are several different layout styles, and these will be described below.</p>
		<h2><FONT size="2">Grid Layout</FONT></h2>
		<p>The grid layout allows controls to be moved around with the keyboard or mouse, 
			and has the ability to snap controls to a specified grid size.&nbsp; This 
			layout style is the most commonly used, as it allows controls to be moved with 
			pixel accuracy, to any location inside a container.&nbsp; The most common way 
			of using the GridLayout is to select the control you wish to move around or 
			resize, then move your mouse over the selection mask.&nbsp; You will notice the 
			cursor change from the default pointer, to the move, or resize cursor.&nbsp; 
			Dragging the selection mask will in turn move the control.&nbsp; Dragging 
			individual nodes will resize the control appropriately.&nbsp;

		<h2><FONT size="2">Vertical Flow Layout</FONT></h2>
		<p>The grid layout allows controls to be moved around with the keyboard or mouse, 
			and has the ability to snap controls to a specified grid size.&nbsp; This 
			layout style is the most commonly used, as it allows controls to be moved with 
			pixel accuracy, to any location inside a container.&nbsp;
		</p>
		<h2>Horizontal Flow Layout</h2>
		<p>The grid layout allows controls to be moved around with the keyboard or mouse, 
			and has the ability to snap controls to a specified grid size.&nbsp; This 
			layout style is the most commonly used, as it allows controls to be moved with 
			pixel accuracy, to any location inside a container.&nbsp;
