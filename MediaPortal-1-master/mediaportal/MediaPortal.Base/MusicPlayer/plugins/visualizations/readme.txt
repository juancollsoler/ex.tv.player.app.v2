This folder contains Visualisation Plugins used within Mediaportal.

Attention:

- Sonique Visualisations can be placed anywhere in this folder or in sub folders. We would recommend using the Sonique folder for that

- BASS BOX Plugins MUST be placed into the <mediaportal install dir>\BBPlugin subfolder, otherwise the Textures will not be found.

- Winamp Visualisations MUST be placed in the <mediaportal install dir>\Plugins subfolder.
  This is the folder, which contains all the MediaPortal plugins as well.
  
  No other sub folders should be created, except when a plugin needs it.
  
  Let's use Milkdrop as an example:
