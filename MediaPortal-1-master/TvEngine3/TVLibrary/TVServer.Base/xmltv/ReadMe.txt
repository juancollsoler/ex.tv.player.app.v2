To use Mediaportal's internal xmltv configuration and scheduler you should unpack the xmltv in this folder.

Download from:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39046

Get the Win32 zip file named like xmltv-0.5.34-win32.zip, depending on the version number.

After unpacking in this folder you can use it from within MediaPortal

You should have something like this in the folder, can depend on version of xmltv:

---------
doc
share
README
ReadMe.txt
xmltv.exe
---------


have Fun!!
