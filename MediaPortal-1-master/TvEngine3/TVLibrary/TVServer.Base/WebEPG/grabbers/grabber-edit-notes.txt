When trying the create or edit a grabber.xml file.

1. First read: http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/MediaPortal_Setup_Customising_WebEPG

2. A web browser can be used to check that there are no errors in your new grabber.xml file.
   They will parse the file and display any errors.

Debugging:

1. Check xml file with a browser

2. Remove all spaces from template section. 
   (use either one line or tabs to make formating more readable)

3. Check the log file

4. Try to load the URL in the log file. Make sure page loads correctly.

5. Re-check the page HTML source and check the listing format


Some problems my be caused by special characters. These can be replaced with codes.

A few web sites that contain a list of these codes (in no order):
